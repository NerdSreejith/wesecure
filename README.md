2. **Enhanced Scanning Techniques**: Advanced scanning methods are being explored to improve vulnerability detection accuracy.
3. **UI/UX Improvements**: The user interface is undergoing refinement for better usability and visual appeal.

## To-Do

1. **Scan Scheduling**: Implement the ability to schedule scans for automatic execution at specified intervals.
2. **Email Notifications**: Enable email notifications to alert users when scans are completed and reports are ready.
3. **Advanced Reporting**: Develop detailed reports with severity levels, recommendations, and remediation steps for each vulnerability.

## Next Steps

1. Complete user authentication implementation.
2. Integrate advanced scanning techniques for improved detection accuracy.
3. Refine UI/UX based on user feedback.
4. Implement scan scheduling and email notifications.
5. Enhance reporting capabilities for comprehensive vulnerability analysis.


## Current Progress: 50%
