### Project Status
- **In Progress**:
  - User Authentication: Implementation is underway for secure user authentication to access the scanner and view scan reports.
  - Enhanced Scanning Techniques: Advanced scanning methods are being explored to improve vulnerability detection accuracy.
  - UI/UX Improvements: The user interface is being refined for better usability and visual appeal.
- **To-Do**:
  - Scan Scheduling: Plans to implement scan scheduling for automatic execution at specified intervals.
  - Email Notifications: Enable email notifications for users when scans are completed and reports are ready.
  - Advanced Reporting: Develop detailed reports with severity levels, recommendations, and remediation steps for each vulnerability.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Complete user authentication implementation.
  - Integrate advanced scanning techniques for improved detection accuracy.
  - Refine UI/UX based on user feedback.
  - Implement scan scheduling and email notifications.
  - Enhance reporting capabilities for comprehensive vulnerability analysis.

### Current Progress
WeSecure has achieved 50% completion. The core scanning functionality is in place, and efforts are now focused on enhancing user authentication, refining scanning techniques, and improving the overall user experience. Stay tuned for further updates!
